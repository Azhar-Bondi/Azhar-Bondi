Tired 😫 and fed up of looking up boring profiles? I can see your eye Strain 👀 through your front 📸 
 camera. 
If you wonder how ? Just a hint: Kevin Mitnick is my cousin .. that's another story we can leave for when we meet! 
But first I want to see that smiley face 😁 of yours since you have just found the right person to work on your project. So no more research and no more pain. 🥊 Hit me with a call 📱. Et voilà c'est fait! But watch out cause I can hit back🥊 Yeah I know I forgot to mention that I'm a black belt in Taekwondo 🥋 and currently a kickboxer. However, I come in peace I promise, cause I am flowers 🌸 ! Yeah that's literally the meaning of my name in Arabic (أزهار).

I find the fact that my name is plural, interesting and beautiful since I really hate when people put me in tight stereotyped boxes 🗃️ 🗃️ 🗃️ …

I am plural > I am Azhar
* the professional 💻 who's gonna save and lighten 🌟 your day and your company's days,
* the passionate learner who's gonna bombard you with questions ❓❓❓ .
*the irreplaceable polyglot who is always present when your company needs an interpreter of Arabic, Java ,French , JavaScript and Portuguese.
Farsi , Go, German , Python are on my List!
*I'm the kickboxer who is going to KO 🥊 your competitors with my creative ideas and hard work. 

Bref … I'm that *muslim woman 🧕🏼 who is going to keep shattering anything that stands between her and her success 💪 …

 See you soon! I bet you are eager to know how I hacked your camera.
